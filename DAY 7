Question 1:-Given an integer array nums of even length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.Return the answer array in such a way that the given conditions are met:

Every consecutive pair of integers have opposite signs.

For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in nums is preserved.

The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

solution:-
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> rearrangeArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> pos;  
        vector<int> neg;  

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0)
                pos.push_back(nums[i]);
            else
                neg.push_back(nums[i]);
        }

        
        vector<int> ans(nums.size());
        int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;

        while (i < pos.size() && j < neg.size()) {
            ans[k++] = pos[i++];
            ans[k++] = neg[j++];
        }

        while (i < pos.size())
            ans[k++] = pos[i++];

        while (j < neg.size())
            ans[k++] = neg[j++];

        return ans;
    }
};

Question 2:- Given an array arr of n integers, where arr[i] represents price of the stock on the ith day. Determine the maximum profit achievable by buying and selling the stock at most once. 
The stock should be purchased before selling it, and both actions cannot occur on the same day.

code:-
class Solution{
public:
    int stockBuySell(vector<int> arr, int n){
      int mini = arr[0];
      int maxprofit = 0;

      for(int i = 1 ; i < n ; i++){
        int cost = arr[i] - mini;

        maxprofit = max(maxprofit , cost);
        mini = min(mini , arr[i]);
      }

      return maxprofit
    }
};
