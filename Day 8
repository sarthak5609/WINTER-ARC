Question 1:-Given an integer array nums, return a list of all the leaders in the array.
A leader in an array is an element whose value is strictly greater than all elements to its right in the given array. The rightmost element is always a leader. The elements in the leader array must appear in the order they appear in the nums array.

code:-
class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> leaders(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> leadersList; // to store the leaders
        int n = arr.size();
        int maxR = arr[n - 1];   // rightmost element
        leadersList.push_back(maxR); // last element is always a leader

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (arr[i] >= maxR) {
                leadersList.push_back(arr[i]);
            }
            maxR = max(maxR, arr[i]);
        }

        reverse(leadersList.begin(), leadersList.end()); // reverse to correct order
        return leadersList;
    }
};

Question 2:-Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
code:-
class Solution {
  public:

    // Function to return length of longest subsequence of consecutive integers.
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& arr) {
          unordered_set<int> s(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        int longest = 0;

        // Step 2: Traverse each element
        for (int num : arr) {
            // Step 3: Check if it's the start of a sequence
            if (s.find(num - 1) == s.end()) {
                int currentNum = num;
                int count = 1;

                // Step 4: Count consecutive numbers
                while (s.find(currentNum + 1) != s.end()) {
                    currentNum++;
                    count++;
                }

                // Step 5: Update longest sequence length
                longest = max(longest, count);
            }
        }

        return longest;
    }
};
